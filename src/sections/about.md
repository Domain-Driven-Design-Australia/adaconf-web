Welcome to ADAConf, an Australian one-day community conference for those interested in software analysis, design and architecture.  It is an off-shoot of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/domain-driven-design-australia/" target="_blank">Domain-Driven Design Australia meetup community</a>.

ADAConf is dedicated to the mission of building software that is more valuable for its users and owners, more pleasant to work with for its builders and maintainers, and more collaborative in its conception & design.

We are creating space for conversations about everything from specific technology problems and how they can be solved to abstract ideas at the intersection of technology and philosophy.

Key dates:

* CfS open: 15th April 2024
* CfS close: 15th July 2024
* CfS process closed and participants informed: 15th August 2024
* Public schedule published: 1st September 2024
* Conference day: 8th November 2024

We will start reaching out to speakers prior to the CfS close, but will ensure we respond to all submissions by the 15th of August

ADAConf will be held at [Rydges Melbourne](https://www.rydges.com/accommodation/melbourne-vic/melbourne-cbd/), 186 Exhibition Street, Melbourne VIC 3000
