Welcome to ADAConf, an Australian one-day community conference for those interested in software analysis, design and architecture.  It is an off-shott of the [Domain-Driven Design Australia meetup community](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/domain-driven-design-australia/), and is dedicated to the mission of re-focussing software development conversations around building robust, resilient, adaptable and responsive software.

We are creating space for conversations about everything from specific technology problems and how they can be solved to abstract ideas at the intersection of technology and philosophy.

Key dates:

* CfS open: 15th April 2024
* CfS close: 15th July 2024
* CfS process closed and participants informed: 15th August 2024
* Public schedule published: 1st September 2024
* Conference day: 8th November 2024

We will start reaching out to speakers prior to the CfS close, but will ensure we respond to all submissions by the 15th of August
