Welcome to ADAConf, an Australian one-day community conference for those interested in software analysis, design and architecture.

We are creating space for conversations about everything from specific technology problems and how they can be solved to abstract ideas at the intersection of technology and philosophy.

Conversations like:

* Modelling, analysis and software design practices
* Deep dives into aspects of building good software
* Bridging the gap between business and technology
* Systems thinking & socio-technical architecture
* Product design & visual collaboration
* Case studies and experience reports
* Failures and lessons learnt
* Experiments and lessons learnt
* Challenges to conventionally accepted ideas
