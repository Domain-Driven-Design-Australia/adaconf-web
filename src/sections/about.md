Welcome to ADAConf, an Australian one-day community conference for those interested in software analysis, design and architecture.  It is an off-shoot of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/domain-driven-design-australia/" target="_blank">Domain-Driven Design Australia meetup community</a>.

ADAConf's mission is to support the building of software that is more valuable for its users and owners, more pleasant to work with for its builders and maintainers, and more collaborative in its conception and design.

<!-- We are creating space for conversations about everything from specific technology problems and how they can be solved to abstract ideas at the intersection of technology and philosophy. -->

Key dates:

* CfS open: 3 February 2025
* CfS close: 30 June 2025
* CfS process closed and participants informed: 31 July 2025
* Public schedule published: 18 August 2025
* Conference day: 14th November 2025

<!-- We will start reaching out to speakers prior to the CfS close, but will ensure we respond to all submissions by the 15th of August -->

<!-- ADAConf will be held at [Rydges Melbourne](https://www.rydges.com/accommodation/melbourne-vic/melbourne-cbd/), 186 Exhibition Street, Melbourne VIC 3000 -->
